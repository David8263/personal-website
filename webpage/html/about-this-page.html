					Hello! Welcome to my webpage! I started this project for INF 286, Introduction to Web Development, at Fort Caswell (Where this photo was taken!)
                    in early March, 2025. Everything on this page was coded by me, without the use of a templet. For more complex issues and bug fixing, AI was consulted,
                    but code was tested and understood before implemented. Essentially, I used AI to get me back on my feet again whenever I got lost as to what to try next
                    to fix the silliest of problems. Whatever edition of the webpage this is, it probably looks nice, but <a href="homepage.html">here</a> is a link
                    to the first edition of the site I released, which is what I submitted for the final! If you are interested in the development over a period of time, you
                    can check out the archive list <a href="javascript:void(0)">here</a>, once there are multiple editions of the site.

                        Like I said above, this webpage was originally created by me during INF 286. This means that the first edition of this webpage uses very little JavaScript!
                        on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page, I used JavaScript to create the navigation bar for the box containing different projects. I didn't know
                        much at the time, but it allowed me to get some early experience transferring some of my Java and Python knowledge while also trying to recall what I could 
                        from all the way back in high school.

                        As you can see on the right, A simple script tag is used to do two things, toggle which div is display: block (which on the
                        <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page is the big yellow box) and which hyperlink has the active class. It accomplishes this 
                        by using global variables to store parameters from previous method calls and then compares the actively called values to previous
                        ones.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        This JavaScript actually caused me a lot of issues, though. I didn't quite understand the document.getElementById() that was used,
                        but I somewhat understood the difference between passing an object and the value that I want to compare (from my previous Java Knowledge)
                        so I knew that it needed to be there. I was having logic issues that seemingly had no basis to exit. This caused a really funny issue 
                        where, at first, I could go toggle on all of the project section highlights... but they couldn't turn off. Then I changed some code around 
                        and I could toggle each one on and off, but it didn't automatically disable the previous active highlight. Finally I came accross a solution... 
                        or so I thought. It properly toggled everything on and off except for one case, when you tried to toggle on one element, turn it off, and then
                        turn that same one back on again. Thankfully though, I recognized quickly that this was because I forgot to update a variable, so it was a quick 
                        fix, but the strange logic that was happening was still a really cool pattern

                        Do you like all of the boxes? I created the system myself, but for the other part of my INF 286 final! It is a simple nested grid within a
                        flexbox. There are two rows in the flexbox, one for content and one for the footer, and then the grid itself has two columns and as many
                        rows as I need, depending on the number of divs I use. This allows me to neatly split of and display all of my content, and I'm really proud 
                        of the work I did! This is because, after my initial set up, it felt a lot like coding with bootstrap... except I created the library! Doing
                        this really heightened my understanding of css and frameworks, and I think it would be a great idea if you want to learn more about how bootstrap 
                        works too!
